# Analyze A/B Results

## Project Details
For this project, I'll be analyzing the outcomes of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce website. The purpose is to work through this notebook to help the organization decide whether they should deploy the new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment for a longer period of time before making a choice.
